# pm-sieve-filters
Several sieve filters of varying quality, intended for use with Proton Mail. Random chunks of knowledge and tips sprinkled in here and there.

Proton Mail supports filtering of inbound emails by use of the Sieve, a scripting language designed for the express purpose of managing email. Sieve is not exclusive to Proton Mail, many servers use it, but there can be platorm dependent quirks in the implementation. If you use any of this code on a different platform, you may have to tweak it, and you should test it to your satisfaction before using any "destructive" functionality.
